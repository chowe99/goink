## How You Can Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or bugs, please create a GitHub issue with as much information as possible. Include steps to reproduce the issue, the environment in which it occurs, and any error messages you may have encountered.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a feature or an improvement, please open an issue on GitHub to discuss your suggestions with the community. We encourage collaboration and value all constructive ideas.

### Submitting Pull Requests

To contribute code to Goink, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the repository page to create your own fork.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix (`git checkout -b feature/branch-name`).
3. **Make Changes**: Make your code changes, keeping our coding standards in mind.
4. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages (`git commit -m "Description of the change"`).

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your fork's branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository.

### Gitflow Workflow

We use the Gitflow workflow to manage our branches:
- **develop**: The default branch for ongoing development.
- **feature/branch-name**: Use this branch for new features.
- **release** and **main**: Releases are tagged in `release` and merged into `main` after validation.

### Coding Standards

- Write documentation if your feature requires it.
- Add unit tests for any new functionality.

## Community Guidelines
